                    <h3><u>Early Years</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889. He was the son of Alois and Klara Hitler. Adolf Hitler was raised in a family of Austro-Hungarian immigrants.
                        His father retired from customs service, which he then stayed in Linz, Adolf's favorite city and where he wanted to be buried at. He feared and disliked
                        his dad, but was loved by his mom. Maria died at the age of 47 on December 21, 1907 due to breast cancer. Adolf left his savings for the family after he died in January 3, 1903 at age 65.

                    <h3><u>Education</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Hitler never went past secondary education, which he left to visit Vienna. He came back to Linz to have aspirations of becoming an artist. He was rejected by Academy of Fine Arts
                        where he lived in a depressive time of his life. He only painted small works for the public and was moving between governmental hostels.

                    <h3><u>Pre-War Period</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Hitler was sent as a World War One soldier and served in the army, thus joining the Nazi Party in 1919. He later became the leader of the party in 1921. Hitler's anti-Semitic ideology and racial supremacy
                        led to rise of support for the post-war era. Hitler gave an attempt to start a coup to seize power in Munich and overthrow the Weimar Republic to create a new government by race. This lead to his
                        imprisonment, where he wrote a Mein Kampf for a racially pure Germany called "The Final Solution".

                    <h3><u>The Schutzstaffel with Hitler</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        The SS (Schutzstaffel) began in 1933, when the Nazi Party declared Hitler as their leader. The SS was formed to prevent anti-Semitism and to keep racial purity in Germany. 
                        The SS was a secret police force that secured Nazi-occupied places within Europe.
                        Many men who were trained in the army were recruited into the SS (usually people who supported Hitler when he was starting the Nazi Party), and 
                        were given access to secret documents. The SS was also responsible for executing Jewish people, since Hitler believed that Jews were a threat to the nation.

                    <h3><u>The Final Solution</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        The Final Solution, a structured plan for genocidewas Hitler's vision and eventual occurrence in the last part of the Holocaust. The Final Solution started in 1941, when Hitler's 
                        party gathered up as many Jews as possible into concentration camps. In addition, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mentioned in their article that "[Although] many 
                        Jews were killed before the 'Final Solution' began, the vast majority of Jewish victims were murdered during this period" ("Final Solution": Overview). This is because Hitler started
                        to give orders to mainly Adolf Eichmann and Reinhard Heydrich, two high ranked SS officers, to kill all Jews in the concentration camps.

                    <p>
                        Adolf Hitler was the leader of the Nazi Party, and was often called Führer (leader) in German. Hitler's role in the Holocaust was to order
                        all soldiers and officers to kill all Jews. Later on in 1934 after Presidents Hindenburg died, Hitler took over power as Chancellor and
                        President, which gave him full power over the government and military.

                        Adolf Hitler committed suicide in 1945, and was buried in a German cemetery. Furthermore, History On The Net wrote in their article that "Hitler's 
                        officers warned him that the Russians were on their way and that it would only take them a day or two to take the chancellery. They urged him to escape to 
                        the Bavarian Alps, to a small town in Berchtesgaden, but he chose suicide" (Why Did Hitler Kill Himself? We Have A Couple Answers). Afterward, Hitler's servants were pre-ordered to
                        dump petrol on the bodies and cremate them. The cremation ashes were later found by the Soviets in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery

                    <p>
                        There are many claims out in the public about why Hitler and his wife - Eva - could have escaped to Alps. Once Hitler got the warning that Mussolini and his mistress
                        were captured and killed to be shown in public. Hitler did not want to end his life embarrassingly, plus the Russians were approaching their hideout bunker at a rapid pace.
                        He decided that committing suicide was the best option for him and his wife.

                        Adolf Hitler was a Nazi leader, and was responsible for the death of more than 6 million Jews. He had a motive to have a nation of anti-Semitism and racial purity. He was called
                        Führer (leader) in German, and his role in the Holocaust was to order all soldiers and officers to kill all Jews. He committed suicide in 1945, and was buried in a German cemetery.
                        He had a despressive youth, but his extraordinary public sentiment through propaganda ended his depression and brought him at the peak of power. His army was not enough for
                        the allied forces, and Hitler was forced to escape to a bunker where he met his death and his wife's death due to suicide.
