                    <h3>Early Years</h3>
                    <p>
                        Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889. He was the son of Alois and Klara Hitler. Adolf Hitler was raised in a family of Jewish immigrants from Austria.
                        His father retired from customs service, which he then stayed in Linz, Adolf's favorite city and where he wanted to be buired at. He feared and disliked
                        his dad, but was loved by his mom. Alois died at the age of 90 in 1903 and left his savings for the family. Due to breast cancer, Maria died in 1908.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hitler never went past secondary education, which he left to visit Vienna. He came back to Linz to dream of becoming a artist. He was rejected by Academy of Fine Arts
                        where he lived in a depressive time of his life. He only painted small works for the public and was moving between governmental hostels.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pre-War Period</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hitler was sent as a World War One soilder and served in the army, thus joining the Nazi Party in 1919. He later became the leader of the party in 1921. Hitler's charismatic
                        leadership in anti-Semitism and racial purity led to rise of support for the post-war era. Hitler gave a attempt to start a coup to seize power in Munich. This lead to his
                        imprisonment, where he wrote a outline of his vision for a racially pure Germany called "The Final Solution".
